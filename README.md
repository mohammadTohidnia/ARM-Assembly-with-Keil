## Tools & Setup

To run the code provided in this repository, the following environment is recommended:

1.  **IDE:** Keil uVision 5.
2.  **Target:** NXP LPC17xx series.
3.  **Simulation:** Most exercises are designed for software simulation with specific clock frequencies (e.g., 15 MHz or 16 MHz) to measure cycle counts and execution time.

## Usage
Navigate to the specific folder for the lab you wish to examine. Each directory contains:
* `startup_LPC17xx.s`: The assembly source file containing the solutions.
* `README.md`: Specific logic, algorithms, and performance metrics for that lab's exercises.
